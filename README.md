# Stock_Prediction
This is the project of Data Science and Machine Learning in which the goal is to predict the stock price of the next day with the help of the previous year and days datas along with other parameters. For this I used the python libraries pandas and Machine Learning package sklearn. yfinance which is a python library that provides a simple interface to download historical market data from the yahoo finance is used as the dataset. After importing the dataset, Plotted the graphs to visualise and for more insights from the raw data. Deleting the unrequired columns and setting the target variable. Then specifying the predictors that we are going to use for the predictions. Used RandomForestClassifier of Supervised Machine Learning for the predictions. Checked for precision_score.Then finally used Backtesting for improving the effectivness of the model.
